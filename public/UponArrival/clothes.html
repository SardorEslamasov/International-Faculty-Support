            <p>Spring is mild, with pleasant temperatures ranging from 10°C to 25°C (50°F to 77°F).</p>

            <h2>2. Cultural Considerations</h2>
            <p>Uzbekistan is a predominantly Muslim country with strong cultural traditions. While the dress code is generally relaxed, especially in urban areas, it’s important to dress modestly and respectfully, particularly in rural areas.</p>

            <h3>For Women:</h3>
            <p>It’s advisable to wear clothes that cover the shoulders and knees, especially when visiting religious sites. Avoid wearing revealing or overly tight clothing. Dresses, skirts, and blouses that cover the arms are a good choice. In more rural areas, it is respectful to wear loose-fitting clothes.</p>

            <h3>For Men:</h3>
            <p>Casual wear is generally acceptable in cities, but it’s recommended to avoid wearing shorts when visiting religious or cultural sites. Long trousers and a shirt or polo are a good balance of comfort and respect for local customs.</p>

            <h2>3. Footwear and Accessories</h2>
            <h3>Footwear:</h3>
            <p>Comfortable shoes are essential as you might be walking a lot, especially in historical cities with cobbled streets. Closed-toed shoes or sandals are appropriate. In winter, insulated boots are a must.</p>

            <h3>Accessories:</h3>
            <p><strong>Sunglasses</strong> and <strong>sun protection</strong> (like hats and sunscreen) are essential in summer. In winter, scarves, gloves, and hats are highly recommended to keep warm.</p>

            <h2>4. Packing Tips</h2>
            <h3>Layering:</h3>
            <p>Due to the varying temperatures between day and night, it’s important to bring clothes that you can layer. For example, a light jacket with a sweater underneath works well for evenings in the spring and autumn.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Respect:</h3>
            <p>Pack at least one modest outfit for visiting mosques or other religious sites. A shawl or scarf is handy for covering the head, especially for women.</p>

            <h3>Special Clothing Needs:</h3>
            <p>If you're planning on hiking or visiting mountainous areas, don’t forget to pack hiking boots, rain gear, and thermal wear. Similarly, for urban areas, pack more casual but comfortable clothes.</p>
