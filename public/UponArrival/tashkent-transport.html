        <h3>Maps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yandex Maps:</strong> Expats accustomed to using Google Maps or Apple Maps may find Yandex Maps to 
                be more detailed for Uzbekistan. It links to the Yandex Go app for ordering taxis and shows the 
                exact locations of buses.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenStreetMap+:</strong> For emergencies or when the internet is unavailable, consider using OSM+.

        <h3>Taxi Services</h3>
        <p><strong>Yandex Go:</strong> Available for both Apple and Android, Yandex Go allows you to order taxis within 
            Tashkent and its surroundings at relatively low costs. The fare depends on distance, car size, and 
            travel time. For instance, a ride from the Tashkent International Airport to Amir Timur Square 
            (Central location) can cost between 20,000 UZS and 40,000 UZS (1.50 - 3.50 USD). Payment 
            options include cash or debit/credit card via the app</p>
        <h4>Advice:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration:</strong> A local phone number may be required to register with Yandex Go. You can 
                buy SIM cards in many city shops or at the airport. Phones bought abroad need registration 
                within 30 days, which can be done online, at a post office, or at the provider's office, as it 
                might be cheaper.</li>
            <li><strong>Airport Taxis:</strong> Expensive rides are often offered outside the airport. For cheaper Yandex 
                taxis, you can walk a few meters and cross the parking area to order one.</li>
