        <h2>Via SWIFT Transfer</h2>
        <p><b>Note!!!</b> Your <b>salary card</b> is <b>not</b> the same as a bank account. A separate bank account is required for international transfers
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>You can also make <b>SWIFT transactions</b> from the <b>same NBU branch</b> where your <b>Uzcard sum debit card</b> is issued.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>To do this, you must first <b>open a bank account</b> at the branch. Once the account is set up, the bank will transfer funds from your <b>salary card</b> to your <b>bank account</b>, from which the SWIFT transaction can be processed.
        </P>
        <p><b>Required documents for the transfer include:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passport</li>
            <li>Your Uzcard Sum Debit Card</li>
            <li>Income verification ( more about Income verification is here)</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p><b>Note:</b> These documents are required for every SWIFT transaction. During your first application, the bank will create a <b>SWIFT account</b> linked to your <b>NBU app</b>. They will top up your bank account from your Humo Sum Debit Card and initiate the transfer. The service fee is <b>0.5%</b> of the transfer amount, plus an additional <b>90,000 Sum</b> (approximately <b>8 USD</b>).
